Tips for Coding:

@1
- Partition Method of QuickSort:
	
	* M-1: low-high method: GFG->Array->Rearrangement
	* M-2: normal method: i=-1, j=0 and iterate linearly for swapping.

@2 
- Memory Pool Concept:
	* Use global memory to initialize the memory pool and
	  then use your malloc function to get memory from this pool.

@3
- Re-initializing the visited array in graph:
	* instead of re-initializing the visited array for each test case
	  use test case number to check if it is equal to test case number.

@4 
- Sliding Window technique:
	* first process initial window.
	* than start processing the rest of the window by sliding it.

@5
- Array implementation of doubly linked list:
	* use three array.
	* one to store elements, two to store left and right pointer.
